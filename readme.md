# Netlify & Jekyll

Inspired from this [post](https://blog.mvp-space.com/10-steps-to-configure-jekyll-with-netlify-as-a-cms-d754d73ea731)

## Get started

You will need docker installed on your machine.
From the CLI type

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Now you can visit: `http://localhost:4000` and see the site.
