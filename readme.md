# Netlify & Jekyll

Inspired from this [post](https://blog.mvp-space.com/10-steps-to-configure-jekyll-with-netlify-as-a-cms-d754d73ea731)

## Get started

You will need docker installed on your machine.
From the CLI type

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Now you can visit: `http://localhost:4000` and see the site.

## Social

I have used [addThis.com](http://addthis.com)

## Calendars

I embedded a selection of Google calendars

## Form Handling

This is handled by Netlify. To view your messages visit the `Forms` section.

## CMS

The live site is [here](https://stupefied-galileo-6dfad7.netlify.com/)

and the admin panel is [here/admin](https://stupefied-galileo-6dfad7.netlify.com/admin)

## Deployment
